1. Animate the logo with keyframes.  (Here is a keyframes reference.) It should start at a width of 25px and grow to 475px.  It should also start with an opacity of 0 and end with an opacity of 1.

    c) 20px of padding on the top and the bottom, 
    d) 50px border-radius on the top left and right corners. 

Check your work. The corners probably aren‚Äôt curving quite as you expected. Use Inspect Element to fix this problem. You will need to utilize a second selector.
